                            The contents of the Application/Services/Website are developed on the concepts 
                            covered in the structured curriculum syllabus prescribed for students of various 
                            courses. The usage or reliance of the Application/Services/Website is not endorsed as 
                            a substitution to the curriculum-based education provided by the educational 
                            institutions but is intended to supplement the same by explaining and presenting the 
                            concepts in a manner enabling easy understanding. The basic definitions and formulae 
                            of the relevant subject matter remains the same. The Firm acknowledges that there are 
                            various means of delivering structured curriculum pedagogy and inclusion or usage of 
                            methods in the Application/Services/Website does not imply endorsement of any 
                            particular method nor does exclusion imply disapproval. Subscription to the 
                            Application, or reliance or usage of our Services or Website does not in any manner 
                            guarantee admission to any educational institutions or passing of any exams or the 
                            achievement of any specified percentage of marks in any examinations.
