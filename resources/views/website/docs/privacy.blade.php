                <p class="sub-text title">How Long Do We Retain Information?</p>

                <p class="sub-text">
                    Currently, we plan to retain your and/or a Child User's Information while your account is active and for
                    at least three years afterward. We may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements.
                    For example, we may shorten or lengthen the retention period for some data if needed to comply with law
                    or voluntary codes of conduct. Further, unless otherwise prohibited, we may shorten the retention period
                    for some types of Information if needed to free up storage space or upon the expiry or cancellation of
                    your subscription for the Services.
